This is a reproducible framework to evaluate gene embeddings against CRISPR Perturb-seq data.

With this tool, we aim to test whether embedding distances align with perturbation outcomes, outperform GO semantic similarity, and support combinatorial gene target prediction. 

We include pipelines for data processing, correlation and retrieval analysis, and multi-regression modeling.

Based on current works from Zhang & Chen, 2025.
